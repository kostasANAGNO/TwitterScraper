-Web Scraping Project-
This code appears to be a Twitter scraper using Selenium, primarily designed to extract tweets.

Imports:

->Selenium WebDriver: Automates the browser interaction (Chrome in this case).
->Other Selenium modules: Used for locating elements, handling exceptions, and managing Chrome options.
datetime, re, json, time, logging: Standard Python modules for handling dates, regular expressions, JSON data, sleep delays, and logging.
->mysql.connector: Likely used for storing data in a MySQL database.
->langdetect: A library for detecting the language of the tweet's content.
->TWITTER_AUTH_TOKEN: Imported from a config file for authentication on Twitter (now known as X).

Logging:

The script is set up to log activities with an info level using Python’s built-in logging library, which is helpful for debugging and tracking the process flow.
TwitterExtractor Class:

->Constructor (__init__):
headless: Specifies whether to run the browser in headless mode (without a GUI).
max_tweets: Sets a maximum number of tweets to scrape.
->_start_chrome: Initializes the Chrome browser session with the specified settings.
set_token: Sets up an authentication token for accessing Twitter. This token is validated, and if it’s not configured correctly, a ValueError is raised.

Methods:

->_start_chrome: Configures Chrome options and starts a browser instance with or without a visible GUI, then navigates to Twitter's homepage.
->set_token: Inserts the authentication token into the browser session and configures it to last for seven days.

Methods:

->search_tweets:

Loops through a list of hashtags, collecting tweets within a specific date range.
It splits the date range into 30-minute intervals (timedelta(minutes=30)).
For each interval, it constructs a URL that searches Twitter for live tweets containing the hashtag and the specified date range.
It attempts to fetch tweets by calling fetch_tweets(), and in case of a failure (e.g., WebDriverException), it retries after a 10-minute delay.
After completing each hashtag, it saves the results to a JSON file (_save_to_json()) and a MySQL database (save_to_mysql()), with delays between each hashtag.

->fetch_tweets:

This method is responsible for extracting tweets from the Twitter page after the search results load.
It ensures the tweets are collected until the maximum count (max_tweets) is reached or no more tweets are found.
It uses find_elements to extract articles (tweets) from the page by locating them with an XPath query (//article[@role="article"]).
There is a check to break the loop if no more tweets are found.

Database Saving and JSON:
The script collects the data and then saves it using two methods:
_save_to_json(): Saves the collected data into a JSON file, one for each hashtag.
save_to_mysql(): Inserts the collected tweets into a MySQL database, with placeholders for the host, user, password, and database name.
Delays:
The code includes several time.sleep() calls to avoid overloading the server and respect rate limits:
150 seconds between requests within the same hashtag.
300 seconds between different hashtags.

The script is designed to systematically scrape tweets based on hashtags within a given timeframe, store the results, and handle rate limits.
